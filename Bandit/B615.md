Pattern: Unsafe Hugging Face Hub download

Issue: -

## Description

Downloading models, datasets, or files without specifying a revision based on an immmutable revision (commit) can lead to supply chain attacks where malicious actors could replace model files and use an existing tag or branch name to serve malicious content.

The secure approach is to pin to specific revisions/commits when downloading models, files or datasets.
