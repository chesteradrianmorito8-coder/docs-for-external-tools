Pattern: Potential XSS on `markupsafe.Markup`

Issue: -

## Description

`markupsafe.Markup` does not perform any escaping, so passing dynamic content, like f-strings, variables or interpolated strings will potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities, especially if that data was submitted by users.

Instead you should interpolate the resulting `markupsafe.Markup` object, which will perform escaping, or use `markupsafe.escape`.
