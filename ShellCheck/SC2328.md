Pattern: Command substitution without output

Issue: -

## Description

Command substitution (`$(..)`, `` `..` ``) appears to never capture any output because the command's output is being redirected.

Decide whether you want the output to be captured (by removing the redirection), to go into wherever it's redirected (by not running the command in a command substitution), or both (by using `tee` to copy the output to both file and stdout).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var=$(tr -d ':' < input.txt > output.txt)
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# If the output should be captured INSTEAD OF being written to file
var=$(tr -d ':' < input.txt)

# If the output should be captured IN ADDITION to being written to file
var=$(tr -d ':' < input.txt | tee output.txt)

# If the output should NOT BE captured at all
tr -d ':' < input.txt > output.txt
```
