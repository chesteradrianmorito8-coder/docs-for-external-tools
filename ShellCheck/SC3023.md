Pattern: Use of undefined file descriptor

Issue: -

## Description

The shell grammar is only required to recognize a single digit before redirections to set the file descriptor, which limits the portable range to 0-9.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# Open FD #10 for writing
exec 10> file
```

Example of **correct** code:

Either rewrite the script to only use FDs in the valid range, or switch to a shell that allows a larger range like `bash` or `ksh`.
