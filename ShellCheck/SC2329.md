Pattern: Uncalled function

Issue: -

## Description

Verify that the function is called. It could be misspelled, or its invocation could also be unreachable (as in `f() { ..; }; exit; f`).

Note that if the example script did not end in `exit`, this warning would not be emitted. This is because the function could be invoked by another script that `source`s it.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
f() {
  echo "Hello World"
}
exit
```
