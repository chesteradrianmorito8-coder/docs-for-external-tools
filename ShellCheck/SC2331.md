Pattern: Use of `[ -e file ]`

Issue: -

## Description

The POSIX standard way to check whether a file exists is `[ -e file ]`.

Bash and Ksh have historically allowed using `-a`, but this has no benefit and some potential downsides. For example, in Bash `[ -a file ]` is true when the file exists, but `[ ! -a file ]` is also true, and unconditionally so, because `-a` is treated as logical "and" between non-empty strings.

Avoid the ambiguity entirely by always using the standard, portable `-e`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ -a ~/.bash_aliases ]
then
  source ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```
