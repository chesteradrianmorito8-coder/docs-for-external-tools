Pattern: Empty character class in regular expression

Issue: -

## Description

Empty character classes in regular expressions (`[]`) don't match any characters, making them useless in pattern matching. They typically indicate a typing mistake or incomplete regular expression.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:
```javascript
var foo = /^abc[]/;
var bar = /foo[]bar/;
var baz = new RegExp("foo[]bar");
```

Example of **correct** code:
```javascript
var foo = /^abc/;
var bar = /foo[a-z]bar/;
var baz = /foo[.]bar/;
var qux = new RegExp("foo[0-9]bar");
```
